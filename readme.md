# Welcome to MathHelper

## Motivation: I started this project solely for my own course work, but still welcome and thank you for contributions

1. Make sure you have python 3.5+ installed
2. Make sure you have a working browser
3. Only tested on Mac/Linux, not sure about Windows (should be working)
