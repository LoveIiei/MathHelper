# Welcome to MathHelper

## Motivation: I started this project solely for my own course work, but still welcome and thank you for contributions

### How to use:

1. Make sure you have python 3.5+ installed
2. Make sure you have a working browser
3. Only tested on Mac/Linux, not sure about Windows (should be working)

### How to run: 

```
git clone https://github.com/LoveIiei/MathHelper.git
cd MathHelper
python3 -m venv env
source /env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 gui.py
```

### Road Map:
- [ ] Add more Calculus helper
- [ ] Add more Statistics Helper
- [ ] Add more Physics Helper
- [ ] Add more useful resources
- [ ] Allow user to choose which part of the Helper they want(E.g only download physics)
- [ ] Allow downloading other Helpers as a plugin
- [ ] Optimize the code

> [!CAUTION]
> if python3 not working, try using python gui.py
