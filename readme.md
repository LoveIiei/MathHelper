# Welcome to MathHelper

## Motivation: I started this project solely for my own course work, but still welcome and thank you for contributions

### How to use:

1. Make sure you have python 3.5+ installed
2. Make sure you have a working browser
3. Only tested on Mac/Linux, not sure about Windows (should be working)

### How to run: 

```
git clone https://github.com/LoveIiei/MathHelper.git
cd MathHelper
pip3 install requirements.txt
python3 gui.py
```

> [!CAUTION]
> if python3 or pip3 not working, try use pip install/python gui.py
